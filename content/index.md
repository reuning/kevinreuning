I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. My research and teaching focus on political parties and social movements in the United States as well as latent variable modeling and social network analysis. On the party network page I have state level parties. If you are interested in using these in research please [contact me](mailto:Kevin.Reuning@gmail.com).
