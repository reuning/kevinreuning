In order to install RStudio you need to first install R (and for Mac you need to install XQuartz). The instructions walk through how to do this and where to find everything.

Mac OSX 10.11+
------
1. Download the most recent version of [R from here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). This will be in the form of R-X.Y.Z.pkg. Currently it is R-4.0.5.pkg.
2. Once it has downloaded click on the file and follow the prompts to install it.
3. Download [XQuartz from here](https://www.xquartz.org/). Once it has downloaded click on the file to load the drive. A new window will open with one icon in it. Click on that icon and again follow the prompts to install XQuartz.
4. Finally download the most recent version of [RStudio from here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). This should look something like 'MacOS 10.13+ RStudio 1.4.XXX'. Once it downloads again click to load the drive and then drag the RStudio icon into your applications folder.
5. Open RStudio to ensure that everything loads right.
