This app allows you to explore state donation networks. Make a selection in each dropdown menu to generate a network. Some state networks are extremely large and so take time to generate. For information on how the networks were generated see the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1177/1532440019892583). Network data is available on the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/state_networks) while direct replication scripts and data is on the [UNC Dataverse](https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15139/S3/9JJNBV) and I've provided a description of how to [work with it here.](/resources/load_networks/) Donation data is from the [National Institute of Money in State Politics.](https://www.followthemoney.org/)
