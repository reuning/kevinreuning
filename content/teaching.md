I believe teaching should be a cooperative experience with students, that they should work as co-creators of knowledge. I implement this philosophy by working to engage students as coequals whenever possible. This leads me to dialogue with my students where we discuss not only the material but how it relates to their lives and the goals of the course. I also strive to always explain the purpose of assignments, focusing on what I expect from students as well as what they should expect from me.
