I have often found it helpful to see other faculty's syllabi while designing my courses. Below are the syllabi I have developed at Miami University and I hope they are helpful for others. 

## POL 306 Applied Research Methods
This course is designed chiefly for political science and public administration students. The goal is to get them comfortable with the basics of research design and regression analysis.
