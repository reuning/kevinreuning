![](images/sppq.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}


# Goals for Today

- Go over some basic language of social network analysis. 
- Load some SNA data into R.
- Start manipulating that 

# Social Network Concepts

## Nodes/Vertices and Edges

SNA focuses on the relationships between different entities: 

- **Nodes** or **Vertices**: The entities that make-up your network.
    - Ex: individuals, animals, organizations, counties, ...
- **Edges:** The relationships that make-up your network. 
    - Ex: Friendship, proximity, exchange of goods, ...

## Edges - Variation and Types

Edges comes in many flavors and can be divided between states and events. 

- States: The relationship is **on-going** (not forever necessarily but it exists overtime)
  - Types: Similarities, Roles, Cognition 
- Events: The relationship is captured by some discrete moment in time.
  - Types: Interactions and Flows. 

## How Events relate to States

Often we use events to identify a state: 

- Two students that are often seen together are likely to be friends. 
- Two students that text often are likely to be friends.  

. . .

We also can think that events lead to a state: 

- Interacting with someone might lead to a friendship. 

## Edge Differences and Attributes

- Edges can be directed or undirected:
    - Directed: Point from node A to node B.
    - Undirected: Are between node A and node B.

. . . 

- Edges can also be weighted. Examples:
    - The amount of trade flowing from country A to country B.
    - How long two individuals have known each other. 
    - The valence of a feelings towards another node (negative to positive)


## Adjacency Matrix 

Networks can be written out as adjacency matrix: 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false 
library(igraph)
library(ggraph)
theme_set(theme_graph())
mat <- matrix(c(0,0,1,0,
                0,0,0,0,
                1,1,0,1,
                1,0,1,0), ncol=4, byrow=T)
colnames(mat) <- letters[1:4]
net <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(mat)

set.seed(1)
ggraph(net) + 
    geom_edge_fan(color="springgreen4", 
    arrow=arrow(length=unit(.75, "cm"), type="closed"), 
    end_cap=circle(.5, "cm")) +
    geom_node_point(size=10) + 
    geom_node_text(aes(label=name), 
        repel=T, 
        nudge_y=.1, size=8)

```

:::

::::

Adjacency matrices are written in row-to-column format. Undirected networks will always have a symmetric matrix

## Edge Lists

The other common way to make write out a network is through an edge list format: 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false 
library(gt)
df <- as_data_frame(net, what="edges") 
gt(df) |> 
    tab_options(
        table.font.size=px(36)
    )

```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false 

set.seed(1)
ggraph(net) + 
    geom_edge_fan(color="springgreen4", 
    arrow=arrow(length=unit(.75, "cm"), type="closed"), 
    end_cap=circle(.5, "cm")) +
    geom_node_point(size=10) + 
    geom_node_text(aes(label=name), 
        repel=T, 
        nudge_y=.1, size=8)

```

# R and SNA

There are two major sets of R libraries used for networking: 


- [igraph](https://igraph.org/): A lot of more basic analysis options, also has python and and C versions as well. Overall easier to manipulate your network objects.
- [statnet](https://statnet.org/): Has access to more advanced analysis, but a lot of it is divided up into additional libraries. 

## Following along

You need to learn by doing. If you haven't opened RStudio yet, do so now.

## Network Data Formats

There are a variety of ways that networks are saved/shared:

- As a csv: 
    - Adjacency matrix or an edge list
    - Sometimes _additional_ data is provided in a secondary csv
- [Graphml](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/): Relatively common open format that is easily editable.
- [GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language): Common open format that is less easy to edit (in my opinion)
- [Pajek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language): Weird old format that is not well documented but still appears

## igraph Object 

In each case we need to load in data and turn it into an igraph object. 

As an igraph object we can easily apply a lot of network methods do it, plot it, etc. 


## Loading Network from an Adjacency Matrix

Start with a network of cocaine smugglers. Download the csv [here](data/COCAINE_JAKE.csv), more info [here](https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets/covert-networks/cocaine-smuggling?authuser=0)


Need to do the following: 

1. Load the csv into R, treating the row names appropriately `read.csv()`
    - Set `row.names=1` so that the first column is read in as row names.
2. Convert it to a matrix `as.matrix()`
3. Convert it to an igraph object `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()`


```{r}
library(igraph)
mat <- read.csv("data/COCAINE_JAKE.csv", row.names=1)
mat <- as.matrix(mat)
net <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(mat, mode="directed", 
                                   weighted=T)
```

## `graph_from_adjacency_matrix()`

There are some options we can set: 

- `mode=` 
    - `"directed"` directed network
    - `"undirected"` undirected, using upper triangle to make
- `weighted=` 
    - `NULL` (default) the numbers in matrix give the _number_ of edges between.
    - `TRUE` creates edge weights. 
    - `NA` creates edges if they are greater than 0, ignore the rest.
- `diag=` where to include the diagonal, set to `FALSE` to ignore diagonals.
- `add.colnames=`
    - `NULL` (default) use column names as the vertex names. 
    - `NA` ignore the column names.


## igraph Object

Calling the igraph object by itself provides some details about the network, including some example edges: 

```{r}
net 

```

## Basic Functions

```{r}
vcount(net) # Number of vertices/nodes
ecount(net) # Number of edges 
```

## Basic Plot

We will make better plots later, but this gives us a quick idea of what our network looks like


```{r}
plot(net)
```

# Network Components

## Dividing Up a Network

- We can group vertices by who they can reach:
   - A **component** is the maximal (largest) group of vertices where every vertex within it can reach every other vertex.
   - Every network can be broken into 1 or more component(s).
- A vertex that cannot reach any other vertices is an **isolate**



## Some Components


```{r network_comp}
#| echo: false 
set.seed(1)
n <- 20
net_sample <- sample_gnp(n=n, p=.08, directed=F)

comp <- components(net_sample)
V(net_sample)$component <- letters[comp$membership]
ggraph(net_sample, "fr")  + 
    geom_edge_fan(color="black") +
    geom_node_point(size=10, aes(color=component)) 

```

:::{.center}
This network has `r comp$no` components, the largest has `r max(comp$csize)` vertices in it. 
:::

## Components with Directed Graphs

When a network is directed, then we need to think about direction.

- **Weak Component:** Is a component if we disregard direction of edges.
- **Strong Component:** Is a component if we follow direction of edges

## Strong/Weak Components:

```{r network_comp_dir}
#| fig-subcap: 
#|     - "Broken into Weak Components"
#|     - "Broken into Strong Components"
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| echo: false

set.seed(1)
n <- 15
net_sample <- sample_gnp(n=n, p=.08, directed=T)

comp <- components(net_sample,  mode="weak")
V(net_sample)$component <- letters[comp$membership]
set.seed(1)
ggraph(net_sample, "fr")  + 
    geom_edge_fan(color="black", 
    arrow=arrow(length=unit(.5, "cm"), type="closed"), 
    end_cap=circle(.5, "cm")) +
    geom_node_point(size=10, aes(color=component)) 

comp <- components(net_sample,  mode="strong")
V(net_sample)$component <- letters[comp$membership]
set.seed(1)
ggraph(net_sample, "fr")  + 
    geom_edge_fan(color="black", 
    arrow=arrow(length=unit(.5, "cm"), type="closed"), 
    end_cap=circle(.5, "cm")) + 
    geom_node_point(size=10, aes(color=component)) 
```


## Calculating Components

```{r}
comps <- components(net, mode="strong")
comps$no ## Number of components
comps$csize ## Size of each component
comps$membership ## Membership for each node
```

# Loading Network from an Edge List

## Process 

Now we are going to use a network of political donors in Ohio. Download the edgelist data [here](data/edge_OH.csv) and the nodal data [here](data/meta_OH.csv). More info is [here](https://kevinreuning.com/resources/network_create/). 

Need to do the following: 

1. Load the edge list and nodal data into R as two different objects `read.csv()`
2. Combine them into an igraph object `graph_from_data_frame()`

```{r}
edge_df <- read.csv("data/edge_OH.csv")
node_df <- read.csv("data/meta_OH.csv")
net <- graph_from_data_frame(edge_df, vertices=node_df, directed=F)

```

## `graph_from_data_frame`

There are some options we can set: 

- `directed=`
    - Directed or not? `TRUE` or `FALSE`
- `vertices=`
    - Adding data to the vertices. The first column needs to match the identifiers used in the ede list. 

::: {.callout-warning}
You can only directly include isolates in edge lists if you have a vertex data frame.

## igraph Object for Ohio Network 

```{r}
net
```

# Vertex and Edge Attributes

## Accessing Them

You can access vertex and edges in your Igraph object using `V()` or `E()`. This is useful to access attributes using `$variable`

```{.r}
V(net)$variable_1 ## Accesses the `variable_1` vertex attribute
E(net)$variable_1 ## Accesses the `variable_1` edge attribute
```

## Example 

There is a `Total` vertex attribute which is the total amount donated: 

```{r}
V(net)$Total[1:10] ## Access the first 10 
```

## Deleting Vertices 

This can be helpful in deleting vertices with the `delete_vertices()` function. Lets remove all vertices where they donated less than $2,000: 

```{r}
verts_delete <- V(net)[V(net)$Total < 2000]
sub_net <- delete_vertices(net, verts_delete)
vcount(sub_net)
```

## Deleting Edges 

We can do the same thing with edges, lets keep just the edges that are marked `"Strong"` in the `edge` edge attribute:

```{r}
components(net)$no ## Everything in 1 component
edges_delete <- E(net)[ E(net)$edge!= "Strong"]
trimmed_net <- delete_edges(net, edges_delete)
components(trimmed_net)$no ## New network is more split apart
```

## Adding Attributes

We can also add an attribute to the network. Here we add vertex attribute that indicates what component everyone is in:

```{r}
comps <- components(trimmed_net)
V(trimmed_net)$Comp <- LETTERS[comps$membership]
V(trimmed_net)$Comp[1:10]
```

`comps$membership` returns a numeric indicator of membership in a component. I use `LETTERS[]` to convert that into a letter instead of a number. 

# Other Formats 

## Loading Network Formatted Data

The `read_graph()` function can load in a variety of native network formats. You should set `format=` when you call it: 

For example using this [ground squirrel data](data/ground_squirrel_smith_2016a.graphml)

```{r}
net <- read_graph("data/ground_squirrel_smith_2016a.graphml", 
    format="graphml")
net
```

# Putting it Together

## Test your Knowledge

The next slide has a bunch of datasets for networks. I want you to do the following:

- Find a network you think is interesting, download it. 
- Open the network in R
- Calculate the number of vertices, edges, and the number of components. 
- Create a vertex attribute for component membership. 

## Databases of Data

- Netzschleuder: <https://networks.skewed.de/> 
    - Click the "CSV" option to download them, the other formats use a strange file compression. 
    - This has some _very_ large networks
- Animal Social Network Repository: <https://bansallab.github.io/asnr/data.html> 
    - Hosted on github, once you find the network, click on the "graphml" to show the data, and then there is a download button the right side with a downward arrow. 
- UCINET Data: <https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/datasets> 
    - Has canonical datasets, poorly maintained.
